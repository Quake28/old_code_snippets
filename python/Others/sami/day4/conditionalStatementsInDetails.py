Conditional Operators
ALL CONDITIONAL OPERATORS, ALWAYS RETURN A BOOLEAN VALUE(True/False)

    ==  checking if, two values are equal
    >   more than
    <   less than 
    >=  more than equals to 
    <=  less than equals to 
    !=  not equal to 
    is  to compare objct and object ids together
    in  to find 1 item in a group of items (set, list, dict)

"""


"""

Assignment Operators
Operators that help make special assignments of a value to a variable
    
    =   store a value to a variable, this is also the initializer
    +=  adds value to old value of the variable
    -=  subtracts value from old value
    *=  multiplies old value with value provided
    /=  divides old value with the provided value

"""


"""

Mathematical operators
Operators that can perform simple math

    +   addition
    -   subtraction
    *   multiplication
    /   division
    %   modulo, remainder after division
    //  floor division
    **  power

"""


"""
number=int(input())
power=int(input())
root=int(input())
print(number**(power/root))

"""

Conditional statements
if...elif...else

min. 1 if

elif is optional, but can be used repeatedly

else is used only once, or none at all


if statements only look for the boolean "True"

"""

Loops

1. For loop - loops that run a set number of times.
    for <variable> in range()
        range(number):
        range(start,end):
        range(start, end, increment):
    for <variable> in <iteratable/list/array>:
        
    x=[1,2,3,4,5,2]
    y=[str(a) for a in x] # y=['1','2','3','4','5','2']

2. While loop - a loop that runs, as long as the contition for while is currently 'True'
    limit=int(input())
    count=0
    while count<limit:
        print(count)
        conut+=1
